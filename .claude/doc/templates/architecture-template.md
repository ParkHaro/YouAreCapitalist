### Key Components
1. **Component A**: Purpose and responsibility
2. **Component B**: Purpose and responsibility
3. **Component C**: Purpose and responsibility

## Component Design

### Component A
**Purpose:** What this component does

**Responsibilities:**
- Responsibility 1
- Responsibility 2

**Interfaces:**
```typescript
interface ComponentA {
  method1(param: Type): ReturnType;
  method2(param: Type): ReturnType;
}
```

**Dependencies:**
- Internal: Component B, Component C
- External: Library X, Service Y

### Component B
[Similar structure for each component]

## Data Architecture

### Data Models
```yaml
Entity1:
  - field1: type
  - field2: type
  - relationship: Entity2

Entity2:
  - field1: type
  - field2: type
```

### Data Flow
1. Data enters system via...
2. Processing occurs in...
3. Results are stored in...

### Storage Strategy
- Primary storage: [Technology and reasoning]
- Caching strategy: [Approach and technology]
- Backup strategy: [Approach and frequency]

## Security Architecture

### Authentication
Method and implementation details.

### Authorization
Access control model and implementation.

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest
- Encryption in transit
- Sensitive data handling

### Security Boundaries
Define trust boundaries and security zones.

## Deployment Architecture

### Infrastructure
```yaml
Production:
  - Region: us-west-2
  - Instances: 3x t3.medium
  - Load Balancer: ALB
  - Database: RDS PostgreSQL

Staging:
  - Region: us-west-2
  - Instances: 1x t3.small
  - Database: RDS PostgreSQL (shared)
```
