## 1. Game Overview

### 1.1 Core Concept
An immersive sandbox simulation game where players become capitalists and experience the logic of capital within an autonomous market economy system. Players influence the world indirectly through capital allocation and strategic decision-making rather than direct manipulation.

### 1.2 Game Philosophy
- **"A game you don't have to play"**: A fully automatable system that ultimately provides the true capitalist experience of capital making money by itself
- **"The Invisible Hand"**: Players don't manage directly but intervene indirectly through capital and influence
- **Balance of educational value and fun**: Learning real capitalist market economy principles step by step while pursuing entertainment as a game

### 1.3 Target Experience
- Early Stage: Learning basic market economy as a small-scale capitalist making direct investment decisions
- Mid Stage: Managing efficient portfolios using automation systems
- Late Stage: Establishing macroscopic strategies while observing a fully automated capital empire
- Final Stage: Experiencing the essential mechanism of capitalism where capital begets capital

## 2. Core System Structure

### 2.1 Basic Economic Units

#### Capitalist
- **Player**: The capitalist directly controlled by the user
- **AI Capitalists**: Competition/cooperation partners with their own tendencies and strategies
- Capitalists don't manage directly but only perform capital allocation and decision-making

#### Pop
- Autonomous citizen groups
- Automatically perform economic activities like labor, consumption, and savings
- Make decisions by analyzing their status and market conditions
- Different behavior patterns by class (low income/middle class/high income)

#### Company
- Economic entities that hire pops and produce goods/services
- Can automatically establish, grow, bankrupt, and merge
- Tradable shares (listed/unlisted distinction)
- Indirect management system through CEOs

### 2.2 Automation System

#### Capital Allocation Mechanism
- When players allocate capital to each area, that part becomes automated
- Real-time switching between automation ON/OFF
- Intervention possible when important events occur even during automation

#### Automatable Areas
- **Investment Management**: Automatic portfolio rebalancing
- **Company Management**: Autonomous management through CEOs
- **Financial Trading**: Automatic trading, hedging, arbitrage
- **Political Lobbying**: Regular lobbying fund execution
- **R&D Investment**: Automatic investment in technological innovation fields

#### Event-Based Intervention
- **Daily Events**: Automatic processing (quarterly results, dividends, etc.)
- **Important Events**: Optional intervention (recalls, strikes, etc.)
- **Major Events**: Required intervention (hostile M&A, financial crisis, etc.)
- **Black Swan**: Unpredictable large events

## 3. Major Game Systems

### 3.1 Financial System

- Differentiated loan conditions based on credit rating
- Chain reaction of loans and bubble formation mechanism
- Ripple effects of central bank interest rate policy

#### Stock Market
- IPO (Initial Public Offering) participation
- Real-time stock price fluctuations and trading
- Management rights exercise based on shareholding ratio
- Hostile M&A and defense strategies
- Insider trading and market manipulation (with risks)

#### Derivatives
- Hedging and speculation through futures/options
- High-risk high-return strategies using leverage
- Complex financial products like Credit Default Swaps (CDS)
- Derivative bubbles and systemic risk

### 3.2 Indirect Control System

#### CEO System
- Authority to appoint/dismiss CEOs based on shareholding ratio
- Different management styles by CEO characteristics
- Relationship management with CEOs (loyalty, independence)
- Securing management rights through shareholder alliances

#### Technological Innovation
- Capital input increases innovation probability (no guarantee)
- Different base innovation probability and investment efficiency by sector
- Prerequisite technology requirements
- Market preemption effect upon successful innovation

#### Government Policy
- Influence policy direction with lobbying funds (probabilistic)
- Lobbying competition with other stakeholders
- Market changes according to regulatory relaxation/strengthening
- Risks and rewards of political-business collusion

#### Global Economy
- Unpredictable external shocks
- Indirect prediction through economic indicators
- International trade and exchange rate fluctuations
- Global financial crisis scenarios

### 3.3 Market Dynamics System

#### Supply-Demand Mechanism
- Demand changes according to pop income and consumption patterns
- Automatic adjustment of company production volume and prices
- Overproduction and inventory problems
- Monopoly formation and price collusion

#### Economic Cycles
- Natural cycle of boom-slowdown-recession-recovery
- Differentiated optimal investment strategies for each phase
- Leading/coincident/lagging economic indicators
- Choice between contrarian and momentum investing

#### Bubbles and Crashes
- Speculative psychology and herd behavior
- Excessive leverage and credit crunch
- Bank runs and chain bankruptcies
- Government bailouts and moral hazard

## 9. The Game's Message

This game goes beyond simple economic simulation, allowing players to experience the operating principles of the modern capitalist system and the power and limitations individuals have within it. Players become capitalists who utilize the system while simultaneously experiencing the process of becoming part of that system.

Ultimately, at the moment it becomes "a game you don't have to play," players will naturally understand the essential mechanism of capitalism where capital begets capital, and the social implications it creates.
